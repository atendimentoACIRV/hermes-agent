## What Hermes Is

Hermes is a personal AI agent that runs the same agent core across a CLI, a messaging
gateway (Telegram, Discord, Slack, ~20 platforms), a TUI, and an Electron desktop app. It
learns across sessions (memory + skills), delegates to subagents, runs scheduled jobs, and
drives a real terminal and browser. It is extended primarily through **plugins and skills**,
not by growing the core.

Two invariants shape almost every design decision and are the lens for reviewing any change:

- **Per-conversation prompt caching is sacred.** Mutating past context, swapping toolsets,
  reloading memories or rebuilding the system prompt mid-conversation breaks the cached prefix and
  multiplies the user's cost; the ONE exception is context compression. Slash commands that change
  system-prompt state defer to the next session, with an opt-in `--now` (`/skills install --now`).
- **The core is a narrow waist; capability lives at the edges.** Every model tool is sent on
  every API call, so the bar for a new *core* tool is high. New capability should arrive as a
  CLI command + skill, a service-gated tool, or a plugin — not as core surface.


## Project Structure

Counts shift constantly; the filesystem is canonical. Load-bearing entry points:

```
hermes-agent/
├── run_agent.py          # AIAgent facade; the turn loop lives in agent/turn_*.py
├── model_tools.py        # Tool orchestration, discover_builtin_tools(), handle_function_call()
├── toolsets.py           # TOOLSETS dict, _HERMES_CORE_TOOLS

└── tests/                # Pytest suite, mirrors the source tree
```

**User state:** `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (settings), `.env` (secrets only), `logs/` (`hermes logs`);
all profile-aware via `get_hermes_home()`.

### Facade + siblings layout

Every former god file is a **facade** (public entry points + the names other packages import) plus
**siblings** `<stem>_<topic>.py`, each owning one topic (`hermes_state.py`, `gateway/run.py`,
`tools/mcp_tool.py`, `hermes_cli/kanban.py`, `hermes_cli/web_server.py`, `cli.py` →
`hermes_cli/cli_*_mixin.py`, `run_agent.py` → `agent/turn_*.py`).

- **Find code by topic:** `grep -rn "def name" <dir>/<stem>_*.py`, not by reading the facade.
- **Siblings late-import the facade** inside functions; never a module-level cycle.
- **Patch where production reads:** a sibling doing `from <facade> import name` inside the function
  makes the facade the seam; a patch on the defining module passes silently.
- **Size and complexity are ratcheted per unit** (`scripts/code_health/config.py`): new functions
  CC ≤ 20, ≤ 300 lines, nesting ≤ 6; files ≤ 2,000 lines; units already over may only go down (move
  a function into a sibling to offset growth, or put new tests in a new test file). Behaviour goes
  in a sibling, never a facade; name ladders become a dict → handler.
- **No re-export shims for internal moves;** internal paths are not API. Moving a symbol means
  fixing its docs in the same PR (grep `website/docs`, `skills/`, every `AGENTS.md`).
